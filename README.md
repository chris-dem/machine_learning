# Machine learning website

Goal is to reconstruct most of the fundamental algorithms used in machine learning from scratch. 

## Rules

The idea is not to build everything from scratch but at the same time, avoid reinventing the wheel.
Therefore, the project will be made mainly using the following libraries

* `Yew` (website)
* `Ndarray` (matrix library)
* `Polars` (Dataframe library)

And any other auxiliary library used to assist in the development of rust code.
